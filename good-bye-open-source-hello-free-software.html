<h1 class="title">Good bye "open source"; hello "free software"</h1>

<p>15 years ago, Eric S. Raymond published <tt>Good bye "free software";
hello "open source"</tt>, that changed the face of the Free Software
community.  In that article, the author defined "the next phase": to
have free software accepted in the corporate world.  15 years later,
<i>it's time to reposition</i>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Looking Back</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  In 1998, free software<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> still was marginal. Although widely
  accepted in technical and academic circles, it could not break
  MicrOracSAPple's oligarchy over the corporate world.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Free Software - Idealism + Marketing = Open Source</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
   Raymond's article was not a technical article.  It was all about
   marketing<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.  It was about hiding the reason why we're making
   our software free, and focus on its <i>excellence</i>; it was about
   turning free software into a commodity, so that corporate people
   would be at ease with the concept.
</p>
<p>
   In retrospect, that initiative brought positive results with regard
   to its objective to bring free software to the mainstream.  Indeed,
   the Open Source Initiative did a lot to promote open-source
   software to the corporate world, and probably played a key role in
   the acceptance of the technology.  And as far as the reasons
   invoked by ESR in his article are concerned, it completed its task
   beyond expectations.  But there's no reason to believe that same
   results would not have been achieved without a label change.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">From Netscape to Google</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
   In 1998, Netscape became the big corporate player of the free
   software world.  With the release of Firefox's source code, that
   prompted ESR and others to ditch "free software"&ndash;the label.
</p>
<p>     
   Then came a whole lot of booming companies using free software and,
   sometimes, promoting it&ndash;such as Google; and prominent software
   companies started "open sourcing" their products; the best part of
   the mobile smartphone market runs on free software; and the NSA
   itself, the world's top employer of mathematicians, released free
   source code to enhance the security of the Linux kernel.  All
   events of the magnitude of the initial public release of Firefox.
</p>
<p>
   Today, most Internet companies abundantly use free software in
   their core business, some give important contributions back to the
   community, either by code or sponsorship of free software projects;
   beyond academia, use of free software became law in governments,
   such as Iceland, Brazil, Ecuador<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, Germany, Venezuela, or
   more recently Uruguay&hellip;
</p>
<p>
   Today, the "fear of free software" is gone, and around the world,
   individuals, businesses and governments embrace software freedom,
   for its excellence, and for other reasons that we're going to
   address.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Why Is Freedom Important?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Everyone has at least a good reason to prefer software freedom over
  non-free software products.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals may want to keep their computing activity in line with
  their ethics, customize software to meet their specific needs; share
  it with their friends, or keep their purchased books off the
  censorship hook of some <del>over-sized</del> misanthropic company.
</p>
<p>
  Businesses may want to cut on the costs of setup and maintenance,
  benefit from the large and efficient community that will fix bugs as
  soon as possible, and keep open the possibility of tailoring the
  functionality, or producing software themselves, at a fraction of
  the cost of proprietary equivalents.
</p>
<p>
  Governments may want to keep a foreign company from operating
  potentially malicious software within their own infrastructure, and
  control their own software production, and guarantee the sovereignty
  of their State.
</p>
<p>
  Each of these points could have been deemed unnecessary, or even
  paranoid, 15 years ago.  But since, we've had Wikileaks, Anonymous,
  forged SSL certificates, Stuxnet, Red October, an illegal war in
  Iraq, Homeland Security, RFID chips, bugged and remotely controlled
  smartphones, etc.  Corporate intelligence and digital warfare are
  not science-fiction anymore: they are facts, and prime time news.
  And "nervous corporate types" do know that paying a license fee will
  not protect their datacenter against a determined attacker, maybe
  even the opposite, given the track record of proprietary software
  insecurity.
</p>
<p>
  But, it can't be for convenience, or cutting costs, or security that
  we're insisting on software freedom.  So, why is freedom so
  important?
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">The Ambiguity of "free"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
   In the ambiguity of the English term "free", ESR and the
   open-source proponents' find their main argument to avoid it: it
   could mean gratis or it could mean empty; why the hell would it
   mean /libre/<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>?
</p>
<p>
   It transpires from ESR's text that the double-meaning of
   free-gratis, and free-not-owned would eclipse the usual meaning of
   freedom.  Indeed, the declared objective is to reassure the
   markets, and give a serious&ndash;as in non-activist&ndash;tone to free
   software.
</p>
<p>
   It is unfortunate that ESR himself did not (want to) realize the
   mistake he made when stating that free software remained "stuck in
   a marginal, adversarial position", antagonist to commerce.  It was
   not then, and is not now: free software <b>is</b> free! You are free to
   do business with it, including selling copies of the
   software<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, although the main business model associated to free
   software is one of service.
</p>
<p>
   Now "free" built another reputation during this period. After a
   decade or more of "free" online services, "free" not only sounds
   like "gratis", but also like a trap: if a product is "free", then
   the product being sold is <b>you</b>.
</p>
<p>
   It's time to assert the meaning of free we're seeking, rather than
   to hide it.  There's no ground in letting hostile parties take over
   the meaning of our own words.  Free, used well, is not replaceable;
   and nobody will argue with the meaning of <i>free</i> in the First and
   Fourth amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Liberté, Egalité,
   Fraternité does not leave any ambiguity as to the meaning of
   Liberté: it's freedom. Period.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">It's About an Ontology of Freedom</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
   Following the tragic September 11, 2001, the dominating powers
   tried to redefine the meaning of freedom in an Orwellian style:
   freedom would mean that the more powerful can do whatever they want
   in the name of freedom, including killing civilians, children, and
   assassinating people without a trial, under the cover of
   anti-terrorism. That "freedom" would mean that you cannot stop
   financial elites from massively robbing the people, and you cannot
   prevent a company that sold you a book-reader from removing your
   books from it. That "freedom" would mean the right to remain
   silent, and to be opposed any word you may say, and that <b>is</b>
   recorded. That "freedom" would mean the right to commit suicide to
   avoid persecution from a hostile government that represses
   freedom-of-speech-against-it. That "freedom" would mean
   slavery. That "freedom" is but a label that denies freedom.
</p>
<p>
   So, if freedom became such an empty shell, why keep using it?  It's
   not about labels, it has never been about labels<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>. But the
   struggle, today and before, concerns freedom<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.8" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>, the
   concept. It's difficult to define by words<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.9" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>, but can easily be
   understood by illustration. It's not a matter of marketing, but a
   matter of ethics; not a matter of semiotics, but a work of
   ontology.
</p>
<p>
   The freedom I believe in is one cooperatively evolving from the
   co-learning of all humans, across Centuries and cultures, in
   addressing ignorance, domination, corruption, malevolence;
   Prometheus brought us freedom, by dissipating the dark veil of
   ignorance, and appeasing the fear born from it. My freedom is one
   of science, one of sharing, one of history. My freedom is never
   attained, and always endangered by conservative forces. My freedom
   knows no boundaries but one: your lack of freedom.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">The Next Phase</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  So it's time to reposition. We need to get back to the roots.
</p>
<p>
  Open-source vs. Free Software has a bitter taste of Us
  vs. Them. Truth is: we're one big family, on one little planet, and
  competition won't lead us anywhere else&ndash;at least not any time soon,
  and we have more urgent problems to tackle than to ponder the next
  Faster-Than-Light travel engine.
</p>
<p>
  The layman starts understanding the importance of transparency in
  public processes: the United Nations made it a point to recognize
  Internet access as a Human Right, but free software does not enjoy
  such recognition yet; Wikileaks keeps demonstrating the proprietary
  secrets of publicly-funded governments' covert ops<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.10" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>; and as more
  unethical practices unfold in the media, the awareness of the
  general public raises sharply about the ethics of foreign policies
  and globalized businesses.
</p>
<p>
  More than ever, we need freedom. If we ever want to live in a world
  beyond short-term-profit, we need to expose and address global
  issues globally.  In order to achieve such a Global Brain magnitude
  of human interaction, we need to embrace computing as a mind
  amplifier, alike the Computer Science and Internet pioneers.
</p>
<p>
  In the next few years, as the old world is still rushing at full
  speed toward a solid wall, geo-strategic tensions will increase.
  How to ensure that these tensions are mostly resolved
  diplomatically, rather than warily?  There's no definite answer to
  that, but some hints inherited from History:
</p>
<ul>
<li>powerful individual action depends on individual freedom
</li>
<li>powerful social action depends on social freedom
</li>
<li>correct decision making depends on the availability of relevant
      information
</li>
<li>dominant forces want to keep dominating, and will use any means
      to stay in place
</li>
<li>cooperation favors intelligence
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Free Software as a Specific Technology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  What can free software do, that non-free software cannot achieve?
</p>
<p>  
  An obvious answer to that question is: "free software gives you
  freedom!"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.11" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  A less obvious answer relates to the very nature of free software, as
  distinguished from non-free software: there lies not a technical
  difference, but a technological difference.  Free software is a
  distinguishable technology from non-free software.
</p>
<p>
  According to Gilbert Simondon's Theory of Individuation<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.12" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>, the means
  of production of an arbitrary technique are deeply rooted into the
  resulting technology ; any open-ended technology can evolve in
  unexpected, and unintended ways ; quality comes by successive
  iterations ; a complex network of simple elements is more fit than
  any static construction (made for a particular purpose) ; etc.
</p>
<p>
  All of this sounds like free software: from the Unix philosophy to
  "write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to
  work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that
  is a universal interface"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.13" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>, to the distributed and iterative
  development model, free software is a good candidate for being a
  distinct technology from non-free software.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, free software guarantees user's freedom to run, copy,
  change, and share original or modified copies of the software. The
  "four freedoms" make free software essentially public; and as the
  software evolves, a <b>copyleft</b> <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.14" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> free software license tries to
  guarantee that it will remain free.
</p>
<p>
  Free software, like non-free software, operates within the legal
  framework of Copyright: it has an author, and, unlike non-free
  software, that author grants rights to use, study, share, and change
  the software, that are irrevocable in the case of copylefted free
  software.
</p>
<p>
  That makes copylefted free software particularly well-suited for
  developing a public infrastructure: its development is driven by the
  needs of the user, and its strong Copyright policy makes it
  available to the public, once and for all. Its development model
  also fosters creativity, by allowing anyone with an idea to
  implement it and propose it to the public: marketing is much less
  important here than excellence of the product; like Science, free
  software relies on peer-review to test its quality and pertinence,
  and does not impose blind trust on its users, like non-free software
  does.
</p>
<p>
  One of the less technical aspects of software freedom, its reliance
  on community, also provides a foundation for cooperation in its
  development: businesses and institutions can share their
  developments and make the software evolve in ways that are simply
  not possible with non-free software.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, free software fosters competition and diversity, where
  non-free software tends to favor monopolies, and industrial
  secrets&ndash;or software patents&ndash;that block innovation. But with the
  source code in hand, anything is possible.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, free software allows flexible support, that can be done
  in-house, or by a chosen service provider. In contrast, usually, the
  normalization of non-free software support makes it difficult or
  impossible to adapt to specific needs of the user.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Looking Omni-Directionally</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
  15 years later, free software has reached its goal of embracing the
  market, and becoming a mainstream technology; and, we're still
  talking about the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  As globalization
  continues, it makes more acute the failures and shortcomings of
  democracy, and the fallacy of "free" markets.  People around the
  world want, and need more freedom, now: all of you, all of us,
  deserve it<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.15" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Free software gives you freedom</b> and it's time to insist (again) on
  that specificity.  The GNU project<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.16" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup> is turning 30 years old
  this year: make it so that 2013 be the year of software freedom.

<p>
  Happy birthday GNU!

<p>
  Thank you open-source, you served well. Welcome back, free software!
