<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I regret I could not come and participate in person at the Unlike
Us #3 conference. When Seda proposed me to release a video, I could
not get my mind to work on it. That's because I come from a world of
bits and clear text over a dark background.
</p>

<p>
When I was 14 years old, I decided to understand why everybody
around me was so drawn to watch TV, when the favorite occupation for
my eyeballs was to pursue little black shapes on paper, that were
forming words, and sentences, and paragraphs and pages, one after
the other, step by step, unfolding meaning I could never have
thought of.
</p>

<p>
What I unveiled over the 24 hours period I spent doing nothing else
than watching TV, only confirmed my intuition: the world is
engineered to deprive us of our humanity, to squeeze us of the
invisible community of the multitude in our own minds, to reduce us
to one, single, visible entity that conforms to the perception of a
theoretical model of "ME": the Homo Economicus, disaffected rational
"being" operating in the virtual world of perfect free markets.
</p>

<p>
When you watch TV over a long period of time, uninterrupted, you
realize that it's nothing but a seclusive schedule, with hours split
into regular chunks by highly targeted advertising: first come
retired people, to consume from the comfort of their homes (they
don't sleep much), then the low-class hard worker, who needs to wake
up early and work more to earn barely enough; the children, to eat a
cartoon for breakfast, wasting the precious first hour of a fresh
brain on enslaving habits and insidious hyperactive-consumerist
propaganda&#x2026; The rest of morning is then dedicated to the
housewife, because she deserves it. Etc. all day long, one can
witness the very fabric of society without leaving their little
square. Over the years, the dumbness of propaganda only grew, to
match the larger sizes of the displays, and to hide the ever bigger
lies of the politicians, and abusers of all sorts.

</div>

<p>
I cannot be with you for several reasons that I will briefly
describe. One of them relates to the panel discussion last year
about the lack of financial support for alternate development. More
projects have sprouted since, and we did a lot of work, as you will
see, but still with a zero-budget line; last August, I had the
opportunity to speak at FISL13, in Porto Alegre, where I exposed my
vision of a cooperative civilization; as I wanted for a while to
work in Latin America, I decided to "miss" my plane back to Europe;
finally, I recalled that there is a law in the Netherlands that
requires people to show their national identity record in order to
participate at an event like Unlike Us&#x2013;last year, I could avoid it
by claiming my identity could be verified with my GPG key, and I was
kindly accepted, against the rule, for the sake of privacy, the
conference topic.
</p>

<p>
I'm stubborn. I never understood, nor accepted, that I could not fly
anywhere I like, as a bird, nor sneak in any ship like a rat. As
members of the most intelligent species known by science on Earth,
we enjoy less rights than birds and rats. I like rats. They were
gifted by evolution the prohibition of idleness: if a rat would stop
gnawing, its teeth would grow in a circle to its throat, eventually
killing it. Unlike us humans, whose idleness is well on the way to
mass-killing us.
</p>

<p>
When idling on Facebook, and similar, er, "services", people not
only waste their own time, but they're actively helping ill-intended
organizations in shaping a world where people like me, who refuse
surveillance, will become easy targets: when everybody else blinks
like a Christmas tree at the airport, not wearing an electronic
signature will become suspicious. But that is science fiction, and
may not even happen&#x2013;after all, what everyone else seems to consider
normal, I often see it as surveillance, and I might just be a
paranoid freak.
</p>

<p>
What we don't see, what we don't hear, what is not within the reach
of our perception does not exist, and we can live happily idling
ever after. Meanwhile, in Burma, the Rohingya people are being
persecuted with extreme intensity. Alarming reports mention an
absolute blackout on media technology, from heavily restricted
Internet access, to torturing and killing people in possession of
cameras or telephones. If it's not visible, it does not
exist. <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
These tactics of blackout have seen a surge in the last few years,
and especially in the last year, with frontal attacks on basic
rights in many countries, including and foremost in the United
States of America, "Land of the Free, Home of the Brave", where
freedom of speech has been eroding dramatically, and the right for a
fair trial is being replaced by preventive incarceration, and
targeted drone assassinations on Presidential order; the United
Kingdom also started removing UK citizenship to suspects of
terrorism, so that they can follow suit and drone them down.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, when we're considering replacing Facebook and the like of
them, we're not simply talking about lolcats, college parties, or
family albums: we're talking about safeguarding fundamental Human
Rights against a pervasive surveillance system that allows
dictatorships and corporate-controlled corruption-ridden governments
alike, to target their employees&#x2013;sorry: their citizens, according
to their paranoia-of-the-day, at will, without any respect
whatsoever for democracy or the rule of law. <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
It's not enough to have the Internet declared a Human Right by the
United Nations: that must be enforced, like any law. It's not enough
to have freedom written in the Constitution: it has to be defended
against more incoming attacks, with more intensity. It's not enough
to crave the latest technology: it has to be designed with freedom
and privacy in mind, invented with a purpose. Whose purpose it is
must not be left to the Man in the Middle: it must be chosen by
those who will use that technology, otherwise the technology will
end up using us.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, there will be a hackathon where the Briar developers and
others will look into ZRTP, a protocol used in the transmission of
encrypted voice over the Internet. We need that kind of technology,
not to hide our misdeeds, but our misfits, our difference where it
can save our lives, our friends' differences when it can save
theirs. Social networking today, and I'm talking about everyday
life, is threatened by interests conflicting with life itself. It is
not just a question of communications or technology: it's affecting
how we learn and educate children, how we think and share knowledge,
art and culture, how we feed and clothe ourselves, how we love each
other, and how we look away from each other.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Police officers secure a dangerous whistleblower threatening peace in the public space.</p>
</div>

<p>
If we are to continue as a species on this planet, we are required
to bring a halt to the folly of these global systems that deny
freedom, deny humanity, deny life itself; we are required to
decentralize power everywhere possible, and make abusers accountable
for their crimes. It's not a game, and there's no opt-out
option. It's happening every day, everywhere, and there's no going
back. We can only choose to survive and thrive as a species, or
choose to idle until the end. This decision cannot be delegated to
anyone, via a sporadic vote influenced by corrupted mass-media, nor
by economic <i>laissez-faire</i>&#x2013;we've seen where the money goes. It is
every single person's responsibility to act or to idle: we're all
victims of this complex movement of globalization, and we're all
perpetrators; idling is accepting the responsibility of letting
ugliness rule the world.
</p>

<p>
But there is some tremendous power we can invoke against the sapping
power of erosion: that of evolution. Evolution tells us that nothing
is written yet, and everything is a matter of interaction. Let's
make it determined and soft like a river, and all of us drops can
slowly and surely reach the ocean, a complex and heterogeneous
diversity of life.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.

That may sound paranoid and pessimistic, but indeed it's realist and
optimistic. Very optimistic even, as others have already given up,
declaring privacy dead. <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> For my part, I think we're still playing
on a political ground, and there's still hope.

<p>
I also see an analogy between the disappearance of gods, from
multitudes to one, and the disappearance of the enemies, from many
"others" to the single invisible foe of terrorism. When that one
disappears, the military powers will have no choice but turn
themselves&#x2013;that is: their citizens, us&#x2013;into the ultimate
enemy. It's already happening. But it's not too late&#x2013;Hollywood is
very good at showing us the paroxysm of the last 5 minutes, it's
"money time".
</p>

<p>
If there would be a background music for that message, so that
hyper-exposed brains in the audience can cope with the lack of video
and still think properly, that would be Fiona Apple's cover of John
Lennon's "Across the Universe", to remind us that the impotence we
may feel facing a pervasive self-destructing social pressure is
mainly issued by our own self-generated dismay. No Messiah is coming
to save us, unless one can find it within her own heart.
