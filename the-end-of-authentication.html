<p>
We've been taught to believe that identity is something defined by
an authority, such as a national State, a so-called "trusted"
third-party, or a Web service.
</p>
<p>
It's time to reset and reboot: identity, and therefore
authentication, is something that each person can, and has to take
care for themselves.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Amidst the smoke screen of global terrorism, and pervasive
surveillance, the yelling majorities call for the "end of privacy"
and other "electronic war" rethorical lunacies.  But there's no war
without a very concrete building in which to prepare it, with humans
making silly decisions, and taking sorry steps; and the post-privacy
pundits won't take a picture of my ass without assaulting and raping
me.
</p>
<p>
In the early days of hacking at MIT, closing an office door, like
setting a password to a computer account, were considered offensive.
That was before the times of firewalls, walled gardens, and global
surveillance.  Now, we know that idealism must be protected with
strong cryptography if we want to preserve what's left of our
privacy.

<h3 id="sec-2.1">Three Myths About Who We Are</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.1">


<p>
But who is 'we'? Am I part of it? Are you?
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2.1.1">Myth #1: I Know Who I Am</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2.1.1">


<p>
Almost all kids in our civilization were born with a name branded
on them by their parents, or so they think, baptised by a
name-giving-authority to save them from some birth defect called
<i>original sin</i>, without a say&ndash;despite their cries, and classified
by a number-giving-authority with a life-long "identity".
</p>
<p>
We're so used to that <b>fact</b> of our lives, that nobody seems to
question anymore being branded and reduced to a name, a number, a
health record, a curriculum, or a job resume.  So much are we
told, and taught, and repeated, that we are the person whose
mugface is on our passport, whose name is on our diplomas, whose
career path make up our resume, that we tend to forget that we're
a living, thus ever changing organism.
</p>
<p>
Then one day, John Doe, a Sales Accountant at Pepper Spray
Corporation, <i>gets out of his mind</i>, slams the door, and drives to
the mountains where he starts planting seeds and watching the sky.
<i>What happened</i> to <i>him</i>? <i>He was</i> so&hellip; Now people talk about
this guy like if he were dead, albeit he just became alive.

<h4 id="sec-2.1.2">Myth #2: You Know Who You Are</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2.1.2">


<p>
Your local instance of a <i>govern-mental</i> institution,
people-in-the-know, marketers, your neighbors, and including <i>your     boss</i>, all tend to put you in nifty boxes whereby they can count
you in a bulk, reduce you to a number, a label, most often
referred to as "your identity". 
</p>
<p>
As you very well know it, people suck; you know: "people"; all the
others, except <b>me</b>.  Well, this arrangement is made for you to
blend in, to comply, to fit in, to obey, to melt in the awful
crowd of nobodies.  But of course, you're not <i>one of them</i>!
You're special, elite.  You'll recognize yourself.  You know who
you are. <b>blink</b>
</p>

<h4 id="sec-2.1.3">Myth #3: We Know Who You Are</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2.1.3">


<p>
Social Security Number, National ID, RFID, traffic cameras,
fingerprinting, biometry, behavior recognition, insurance record,
health record, drug test, police record, financial record,
purchase record, loyalty card&hellip;  Cookies, LSO, recommendations,
avatar, login. Register. Like it or not, <i>we know who you are</i>
(and much, much better than you do).
</p>
<p>
The SSL certificate infrastructure is broken! Illegal phone
tapping is widespread! Large customers databases get compromised!
ISPs watch their customers browsing habits! The NSA is recording
all Internet and phone traffic! That's a pretty grim picture we're
being told about the current state of the global surveillance
society.
</p>
<p>
Faced with such pervasive surveillance, where walking against the
crowd is a deviant pattern detected by video cameras, there's a
single step to abandon to the insisting wave of defeatism, and
kiss goodbye to privacy.
</p>
<p>
Yet, even Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, who famously said that it
"wants to know everything about you", concedes that with 48 hours
of video uploaded to Youtube every minute, there's no way the
company can do anything before the fact. I like to take this as a
reference before conceding any stress to the Orwellian propaganda
that reclaims total control over our lives <i>for our own safety</i>.

<i>persona</i>, the mask.

<h3 id="sec-3.1">The Right To Heteronymity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.1">


<p>
In our degenerate society, I wear the mask that was granted to me
at birth, only when I interact with the bureaucracy that made it
for me, for any reason, but certainly not my freedom, nor anyone
else's freedom.  Otherwise, I keep moving among personas, forging
avatars as I create new interactions, merging some to my greater
self, deflecting others to dead ends as I see fit, as to avoid
profiling, spying, stalking, judgement, and diversion.
</p>
<p>
Who needs to know whether I pray for a god, whether I write poetry,
what is my sexual practice, or my political preferences? If I want
to share it with you, I will. You may not even recognize me.

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2">Identical, Yet Different</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.2">


<p>
That is not to say that names, or to make things clear&ndash;here I can
use the word: an identity, is something to avoid. It's not. Bearing
a stable identity is mostly useful.  It allows for others to
establish a <i>durable</i> link, and build trust in you. It provides a
<i>stable</i> path to recognition, an <i>endpoint</i> for communication.
</p>
<p>
Identity becomes problematic when it's used beyond its scope: for
example, as a container for your self.  Such examples abound, and
mostly bring harm, usually <i>permanent damage</i>, to the <i>identified</i>
person: an atheist, a Black, a Christian, a diabetic, a dissident,
an enemy, an infidel, a Jew, a Muslim, a woman, etc.; or to
society: a criminal, a terrorist, a child, a hero, a politician.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.3">Cryptographic Identity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.3">


<p>
An cryptographic identity is a way to establish <i>with enough    certainty</i>, now and for the duration of our purpose, that <i>whoever    that is</i>, the entity with whom we're interacting with remains the
same, i.e.: is identical.
</p>
<p>
"Enough certainty" depends on the risk both parties are willing to
take before they can establish contact and proceed with their own
business. "Whoever that is" pinpoints the important feature of the
identity requirement for any secure transaction: nobody needs to
know your name, your gender, nor your birth date, in order to
fulfill <b>most</b> purposes.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we propose that instead of establishing permanent
identities sanctioned by a third party, we can use instead
permanent endpoints (ourselves, the people we know and trust,
mathematics) combined with anytime-revocable-identities,
one-time-identities, and other forms of unique or idempotent
instrument&ndash;a cryptographic principle, and reputation systems, when
needed.
</p>
<p>
The purpose here is not to cover all use-cases, nor to deny the
need for edge cases, such as the need for accountability in a
financial transaction, age verification to comply with some legal
constraint, or a national security clearance.  The goal is to
provide individuals with a hassle-free security standard that will
reinforce their privacy the larger the adoption, with few or no
side-effects.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">IDENTical diversITY</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
The proposed standard is based on existing well-known cryptographic
principles, designs, and protocols. It leverages the public key
infrastructure, RSA encryption, Transport Layer Security, OpenPGP,
Bitcoin, Git, etc.
</p>
<p>
Each person bears one or more cryptographic key pairs, each attached
to a unique, distinct, and unrelated identity.  Any given key can be
derived, so that the main identity can be infered from it, but
easily revoked by the owner. Does it sound like OpenPGP? Yes.
</p>
<p>
Combine it with TLS, and you have&hellip; Monkeysphere! Forget about
Certificate Authorities, and you obtain&hellip; WebID! Now, loop back to
step one: how do you ensure trust, reputation, and secure
distribution of keys? That's the hard problem.
</p>
<p>
I'd say: let's propagate WebID, build the tools to generalize
MonkeySphere, and from there we can figure out how to merge in what
has been learned from Bitcoin, Git, and others.
</p>
<p>
What about OAuth? Use an One Time Password derived from a WebID, and
you're set. Transaction done? Key revoked. Need multiple
transactions? Generate a different key for each consumer, and for
each action that the consumer is authorized to make. Only one key is
needed, with infinite tokens available, all revocable at once.
</p>
<p>
What about offline? Stick to RSA.
</p>
<p>
Isn't it what everybody has been trying to do? Yes, it certainly is,
and there's been progress on all fronts! I remember the time, before
MonkeySphere, when the buzz what that it's impossible to share a key
between SSH and SSL. Times change. They change faster with a shared
vision.
